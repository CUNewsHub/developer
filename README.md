### NewsHub developer

This repository is used to store deployment code (written in ruby and using capistrano) and also wiki pages on how is the project structured.

There are a couple wiki pages explaining the vast majority of problems/ideas behind development using django, in case you have any further questions report an issue in this repo, or contact me.
